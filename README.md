Upload and clean transactions from China-based financial institutions

This repository is built with NextJS.

It will allow you to upload all raw transaction downloads from Chinese-based financial institutions, including Alipay, Wechat Pay, China Construction Bank, Bank of China, ICBC, etc.

You'll still need to manually download the transactions yourself, because no Chinese institution provides any API access.

See here for [instructions on how to download your transactions](https://youngchingjui.notion.site/Downloading-Transactions-in-China-185f49c2b39d427e9c82e10041e281a9?pvs=74)
